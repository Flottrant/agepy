Installation
============

Currently the *agepy* package is not yet distributed via conda or pip.

However, you can install the package directly from the `GitHub`_ 
repository with pip.
If you have no intention of developing code yourself and just want quick
access to the functions and programs, you can install with ::

    pip install git+https://github.com/exp4-age/agepy.git

in your virtual environment. This will create a temporary clone of the 
repository and build the package. If there is a new version in the
GitHub repository, you can upgrade with ::

    pip install git+https://github.com/exp4-age/agepy.git --upgrade

.. note::

    If you are using the *Anaconda Navigator* go to your 
    environments, choose / create an environment, click on the play
    button and select *Open Terminal* and run the command.

.. note::

    If you want to help develop and contribute to the package, first 
    clone the repository to your PC and install in editable mode 
    (detailed tutorial in the :doc:`contribute` section).
